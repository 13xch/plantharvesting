# plantharvesting
A python script that determines what plants/crops can be planted at the current date/month based on ZIP code.

This script is in development. At it's current state (1.4), it accepts user input for zip code, and outputs the USDA climate hardiness zone, although there is not yet an accurate output for plants to be planted in the current season.
